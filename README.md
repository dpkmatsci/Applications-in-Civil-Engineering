# Applications in Civil Engineering

This repository provides a collection of MATLAB codes written for the following problems in Civil Engineering

    Calculation of the amount of ingredients in concrete mix using IS 10262:2009

    Structural analysis of 2D Frames using the stiffness matrix method

    Calculation of Response-spectra from ground acceleration data 

    Structural analysis of 2D and 3D Truss using stiffness matrix method

 ## Deployment

All above codes have been tested with MATLAB R2022b, but must be compatible with previous versions as old as MATLAB 2017b. To deploy these projects, install MATLAB and follow the documentation provided in the respective folders.
